This website was created to showcase my data analysis and visualization projects. It is also a place where I can (hopefully) contribute to the R community by providing tutorials on fixes I've discovered for my seemingly common coding questions.

### Background

I lived in Cambridge, MA for the past decade before returning to Salt Lake City, where I grew up. I had the pleasure of working for a large economics think tank in Cambridge and still feel a strong affinity and respect for economists. My BA is in Middle East studies, from the University of Utah, and my master's degree is in theological studies, from Harvard Divinity School. I have always sought to understand why humans behave the way they do, and that thirst has led me on a circuitous route to data science. My father is a sociologist, so I've always believed social science can be found in my genome.
